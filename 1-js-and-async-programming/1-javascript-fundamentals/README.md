## JavaScript Fundamentals

This module includes **5 hands-on exercises**, each designed to help you reinforce core JavaScript concepts.

Every exercise comes with its own set of **unit tests** to verify your solution. Your goal is to implement the code for each exercise and run the corresponding tests to ensure correctness.

### ðŸ§ª How to Run the Tests

Use Jest to execute the test files directly:

```bash
npm run test 1-time-difference.spec.js
```

Alternatively, you can listen for file changes and run the tests automatically:

```bash
npm run test:watch 1-time-difference.spec.js
```

### Tips for Success

- Carefully read the description of each exercise.
- Focus on writing clean and readable code.
- Apply the concepts covered in the provided learning materials.
