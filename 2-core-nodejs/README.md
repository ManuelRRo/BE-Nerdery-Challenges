## Core Node.js Modules

### Wishlist Tracker

In this hands-on exercise, you'll apply the Node.js knowledge you've gained to build a practical command-line application. This project will reinforce your understanding of core Node.js concepts including file system operations, command line interfaces, and data manipulation without relying on external packages.

### The Challenge: "Wishlist Tracker"

**Description**
Create a simple command-line tool to manage a personal wishlist. Users should be able to add, view, update, and delete items from their wishlist, each with a name, price, and store.
