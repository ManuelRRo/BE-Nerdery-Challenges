/**
 * Challenge: Create a deep clone function
 *
 * Create a function that takes an object and returns a deep clone of that object. The function should handle nested objects, arrays, and primitive types.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - The function should accept an object of any type.
 * - It should return a new object that is a deep clone of the original object.
 * - The function should handle nested objects and arrays.
 * - It should handle primitive types (strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined).
 * - The function should not use any external libraries
