/**
 * Challenge 1 - Type definitions
 *
 * You need to define proper TypeScript types for the product catalog data.
 * These types should accurately represent the structure of the JSON data and establish
 * the relationships between different entities (e.g., products and brands).
 *
 * Consider:
 * - What properties are optional vs required?
 * - What are the appropriate primitive types for each field?
 * - How should nested objects be represented?
 * - Where can you use union types or literal types?
