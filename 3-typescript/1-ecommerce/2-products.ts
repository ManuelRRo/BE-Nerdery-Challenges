/**
 * Products - Challenge 1: Product Price Analysis
 *
 * Create a function that analyzes pricing information from an array of products.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Create a function called `analyzeProductPrices` that accepts an array of Product objects
 * - The function should return an object containing:
 *   - totalPrice: The sum of all product prices
 *   - averagePrice: The average price of all products (rounded to 2 decimal places)
 *   - mostExpensiveProduct: The complete Product object with the highest price
 *   - cheapestProduct: The complete Product object with the lowest price
 *   - onSaleCount: The number of products that are currently on sale
 *   - averageDiscount: The average discount percentage for products on sale (rounded to 2 decimal places)
 * - Prices should be manage in regular prices and not in sale prices
 * - Use proper TypeScript typing for parameters and return values
 * - Implement the function using efficient array methods
 *

/**
 *  Challenge 2: Build a Product Catalog with Brand Metadata
 *
 * Create a function that takes arrays of Product and Brand, and returns a new array of enriched product entries. Each entry should include brand details embedded into the product, under a new brandInfo property (excluding the id and isActive fields).
 *  e.g
 *  buildProductCatalog(products: Product[], brands: Brand[]): EnrichedProduct[]

  Requirements:
  - it should return an array of enriched product entries with brand details
  - Only include products where isActive is true and their corresponding brand is also active.
  - If a productâ€™s brandId does not match any active brand, it should be excluded.
  - The brandInfo field should include the rest of the brand metadata (name, logo, description, etc.).

 * - Each product should have only one image in the images array.
 * - The image should be the first one in the images array.
 * - If a product has no images, it should be excluded from the result.
 * - The function should return an array of Product objects with the modified images array.
