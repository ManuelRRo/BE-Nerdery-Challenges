# TypeScript Module Challenges

This repository contains the challenges for the TypeScript module, designed to test and enhance your understanding of TypeScript's type system and its application in practical scenarios.

## Structure

The challenges are divided into two main parts:

1.  **Ecommerce:** This section focuses on applying TypeScript to model and manipulate data related to an e-commerce platform. It includes three sub-challenges, each dealing with a specific aspect of the e-commerce domain, utilizing data from the JSON files located in the `data` folder within the `1-ecommerce` directory.

    - **1.0 Types:** The goal here is to define precise TypeScript types that accurately represent the structure of the data provided in the JSON files. This emphasizes understanding data shapes and translating them into robust type definitions.

    - **1.1 Products:** This challenge involves implementing various code logic related to products using the provided data. The focus is on leveraging TypeScript's type inference capabilities to ensure type safety while performing operations on product data.

    - **1.2 Brands:** Similar to the Products challenge, this section requires you to implement code logic specific to brands, again utilizing the data from the JSON files. The emphasis remains on type safety and effective use of TypeScript features.

    - **1.3 Departments:** This challenge focuses on implementing code logic for departments, using the provided JSON data. You will practice working with typed data to implement the required functionalities.

2.  **Custom Utility Types and Generics:** This section delves into more advanced TypeScript features, challenging you to create your own utility types and a generic deep clone function.

    - **2.1 Custom Utility Types:** This challenge presents six exercises where you will recreate built-in utility types like `ReadOnly` and `ReturnType`, as well as build custom ones such as `OmitByType` and `MyAwaited`. These exercises will solidify your understanding of conditional types and type manipulation.

    - **2.2 Deepclone:** This challenge requires you to implement a generic function that can perform a deep clone of any given object. This exercise will test your understanding of generics and how to handle potentially complex object structures in a type-safe manner.

### Tips for Success

- Read each exercise carefully: Understand the data and its structure before diving into the code.
- Focus on clear and concise typing: The goal is to make the types as descriptive and type-safe as possible.
- Use TypeScript features effectively: Leverage features like generics, utility types, and union types to write reusable and type-safe code.
- Test your code: Ensure that your TypeScript code compiles without errors and behaves as expected.
- Don't use any or unknown types: The goal is to create type-safe code, so avoid using these types unless absolutely necessary.
